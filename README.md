# 3D_Reconstruct_Test
used to implement astra reconstructions and process data
- astraRecon files: Used to run astra reconstructions with save paths, iteration number and gaussian blur as variables to adjust
- Proj error: Used to extract projections from each reconstruction and calculate mean square error with experimental projections
